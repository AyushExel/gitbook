# Spread the Word

### 1\) Give us a shout out.

We want more people to user our tool and most of our users say they find out about our tool from a colleague. 

Please give [@weights\_biases](https://twitter.com/weights_biases) a shoutout on twitter, leave a review on [product hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/weights-biases), comment on [reddit's machine learning experiments](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ba6c7g/discussion_how_do_you_manage_and_keep_track_of/) thread.  It really helps us out.

### 2\) Write a blog post on what you're doing

We love blog posts written by users.  If you do something cool with wandb, please tell us about it.

### 3\) Send us product feedback

File a github issue at [github.com/wandb/client](https://github.com/wandb/client), we love feedback and we try hard to implement what out users are asking for.
