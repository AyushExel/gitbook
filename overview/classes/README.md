# Classes and Teachers

We love seeing wandb used in classrooms!  When everyone in a class uses wandb it's easy for everyone to see each others work, which can help learning and collaboration.  We've also seen wandb help teachers by making grading more systematic.  

If you create a project and set its privacy to "open" then students can all submit to a single place.  You are also welcome to use our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/lukas/ml-class) full of example code for teaching.

If you are teaching a class, we would love to support you.  Please reach out to us in the chat below or at support@wandb.com.
