# Artifacts

Artifacts is the latest product in the Weights & Biases toolkit, focusing on dataset versioning, pipeline tracking, and model management. Users reached out after trying solutions like DVC and Pachyderm, asking for a way to neatly integrate with W&B. We're iteratively building this new product with feedback from our pilot users. If you'd like to join the private pilot, email Carey at carey@wandb.com.
