# Local Common Questions

## First time stet up 

The first time you launch local we will automatically log you in and prompt you to create a user with email and password. You should use that email and password that you originally used to log back in. If you need to reset the password you can start wandb/local with the LOCAL\_RESTORE environment variable set and use the temporary username / password that's printed out in the docker logs
