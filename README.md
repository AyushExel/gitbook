# Weights & Biases

Weights & Biases helps you keep track of your machine learning experiments. Use our tool to log hyperparameters and output metrics from your runs, then visualize and compare results and quickly share findings with your colleagues.

Our tools work with your machine learning infrastructure: AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, Azure, and on-prem machines.

## Tools

### [Dashboard](app/)

* Machine learning experiment tracking
* Visualize metrics, compare results
* Share findings with collaborators in reports

### [Reports](reports.md)

* Keep interactive notes of your progress
* Share findings with colleagues
* Save interactive dashboards

### [Sweeps](sweeps/)

* Hyperparameter search and tuning
* Model optimization
* Automating jobs

### [Artifacts](artifacts/)

* Dataset versioning
* Model management
* Pipeline tracking

## Getting Started

Easily add our package, `wandb`, to your model script.

* [Quickstart](quickstart.md)
* [Keras integration](library/frameworks/keras.md)
* [PyTorch integration](library/frameworks/pytorch/)
* [TensorFlow integration](library/frameworks/tensorflow.md)

Here's a sample screenshot from a [Species Identification project](https://app.wandb.ai/stacey/curr_learn/reports?view=stacey%2FSpecies%20Identification) in W&B.
