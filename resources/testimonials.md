### André Aquilina, Computer Vision Engineer at Dysis Medical

Between architecture, hyper parameters and general problem approach, I always found myself going in circles trying to keep track of results, configs and the code version I was using in an experiment. After looking around for a tool/dashboard to help with experiment management I landed on WandB. With one init line I could track many of the metrics I was interested in. Wandb one of the few tools that makes it so easy that it’s a no brainer to try for yourself.

### **Ian Thompson,** [**Latent Space**](https://www.latentspace.co/)\*\*\*\*

"I didn’t think we’d be even considering abandoning TensorBoard at this point. The biggest advantage of wandb viz over TensorBoard for us is the ability to modify viz and sweep reports more easily after the runs have already started. We’ve been using this a lot especially with long runs and sweeps where we realize midway through there’s another way to think about the data/problem. It’s also been super helpful for communicating with an increasing number of remote collaborators and researchers. 

We’re mocking out sweeps as a placeholder for things like “Figure 3” in a potential paper before running it, but with a little cleanup we could turn those sweep visualizations into the Figure 3 in the paper! It’s great to not have to go to a separate notebook for this, and have one place where multiple people can analyze and contribute."

### Mohamed Raga, PhD student at NTU, Singapore 

I am impressed daily by wandb and the amazing visualization tools. Now I present all my works and experiments through wandb— no more slides. I also, send progress report to my supervisor using wandb. The synchronization with TensorBoard helps me to further use embedding projector. So far, I have explored all the wandb tools, but I can't wait to explore more.

### Henry Howard, [iBRAN](https://www.monash.edu/medicine/ccs/neuroscience/research/law-group), Alfred Hospital

Great interface. Does what I want it to do without much effort.

### Michael Oblak, COO at SmartLunch

10/10. It's really great software. Helps me a ton with my work. Also, sweeps handle a lot of my work.

### [Matthew Clapp](https://itsayellow.com/), PhD from Johns Hopkins

Effortless python usage, and excellent visualization of my experiments. Minimal hassle, maximum benefit.

### Ivan Oršolić, [Ori Codes](https://ori.codes/)

Your tool is very easy to set up \(well documented!\) and works great.

### Dongwhan Jang, Seoul National University

Awesome UI for logging. Cross-platform\(library\) support. Excellent customer service. Free for an academic use. Easy for beginners etc.

### **Rajesh, Nokia**

10/10. It is purely awesome!

### Apoorve, Frost Labs

WANDB has made experimentation just so much more easy! I cannot express how much I love WANDB and how dependent our team has become on this wonderful tool. Love from India!  


### Taufiquzzaman Peyash, [North South University](http://www.northsouth.edu/)

I really like the visualizations and it's very easy to integrate with the pipeline.
