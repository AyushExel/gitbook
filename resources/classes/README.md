# Classes

W&B is a great tool for learning and collaboration. We offer free academic accounts, and we've collected some good resources for helping you and your students navigate complex machine learning projects.

## Features

**Academic Teams**

Request an [academic team](https://www.wandb.com/academic) to get started having your students submit results to a shared workspace. Grading projects is easy when you can see the real, tracked results and the code that students used to generate models.

**Reports**

Ask your students to submit reports so you can explore their results and compare new projects against previous baselines.

## Resources

1. [Video Tutorials](https://www.wandb.com/tutorials): Lukas and Chris have built a library of short tutorial projects with notes on each class section. Reach out to vanpelt@wandb.com with questions.

If you create a project and set its privacy to "open" then students can all submit to a single place. You are also welcome to use our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/lukas/ml-class) full of example code for teaching.

If you are teaching a class, we would love to support you.  Please reach out to us in the chat below or at support@wandb.com.
