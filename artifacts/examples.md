# Artifacts Examples

Try a quick example in Google Colab to see how Weights & Biases Artifacts work.

[Try the notebook →](https://bit.ly/wandb-artifacts-colab)

For a more in-depth example, try our two GitHub demo projects:

1. \*\*\*\*[**Dataset versioning**](https://github.com/wandb/artifacts-examples/tree/master/dataset-versioning)**:** An end-to-end example of how to version datasets with W&B artifacts.
2. \*\*\*\*[**Detectron 2**](https://github.com/wandb/artifacts-examples/tree/master/detectron2): Image segmentation and bounding box prediction— visualize training metrics and predictions in real time, store and organize trained models, automatically track model fine-tuning, and save results
