  Common questions about using rich media with W&B, including logging images and
  video
---

# Rich Media

### **How do I log images from different epochs and compare them?**

Each time you log images from a step, we save them to show in the UI. Pin the image panel, and use the **step slider** to look at images from different steps. This makes it easy to compare how a model's output changes over training.

### **How do you log a PNG?**

If you're manually logging, we'll log a PNG with:

```text
wandb.log({"example": wandb.Image(...)})
```

### **How do you log a JPEG?**

We'll save a JPEG if you call:

```text
wandb.log({"example": [wandb.Image(...) for i in images]})
```

###  **Can you log a video?**

Yes. You can see video files in the file pain and download them if you log them

### **Can you pass multiple images through each epoch?**  

```text
wandb.log (image)
```

### **How do you visualize training every N \(500\) iterations?**

I.E. log loss every 500 batches, and log validation images every 2500 batches
