# Table

On the project page, we show runs in a sidebar. Expand the sidebar to view a table of  hyperparameters and summary metrics across runs.

## Resize the sidebar

Would you like to make more space for the graphs on the project page? Click and drag the edge of the column header to resize the sidebar. You'll still be able to click on the eye icon to turn on and off runs on the graphs.

## Add sidebar columns

On the project page, we show runs in a sidebar. To show more columns:

1. Click the button in the upper right corner of the sidebar to expand the table.
2. On a column header, click the dropdown menu to pin a column.
3. Pinned columns will be available in the sidebar when you collapse the table.

Here's a screen capture. I expand the table, pin two columns, collapse the table, then resize the sidebar.

## Bulk select runs

Delete multiple runs at once, or tag a group of runsâ€” bulk selection makes it easier to keep the runs table organized.

## Move runs between projects

To move runs from one project to another:

1. Expand the table
2. Click the checkbox next to the runs  you want to move
3. Click move and select the destination project
