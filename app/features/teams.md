# Teams

Use our private teams feature to collaborate on private projects. If you'd like to set up a private team, please message us at contact@wandb.com. 

## Common Questions

### How do I see the privacy settings of all projects in my team?

You can see the privacy settings of all team projects on the team settings page:  
app.wandb.ai/teams/my-awesome-team

Here's what the settings look like. In this screenshot the toggle is on, which means all projects in the team are only visible to the team.
