# Report Page

Use reports to describe your process developing models. Report sections each have their own run sets, so you can show comparisons of different runs from different projects in the same page. Panels in reports include visualizations, markdown, and images. Here's an [example report](https://app.wandb.ai/stacey/estuary/reports?view=stacey%2FDistributed%20Training) on distributed training.

## Add visualizations and markdown

Click the "Add a visualization" button to add a new graph.

Select what kind of visualization you'd like to use. We'll start with a line plot.

There are plenty of settings to customize your line plot. Select a metric to compare across runs.

## Sections

If you'd like to compare a different set of runs, create a new section. Each section's graphs are controlled by the table in that section.
